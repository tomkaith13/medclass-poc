# Medical Specialty Classifier
<tbd>

## Usage
This code uses [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) + VertexAI via LiteLLM integration.
It also uses ReAct paradigm to extract coordinates using [Google Maps MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/google-maps)
Read these [pre-requisites](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vertex#pre-requisites)
So to setup the creds, hit
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login  
```

And ensure u add your respective `project` and `location` in `.env` file which gets loaded up at init.
Use this command to kickstart the webserver:
```bash
 fastapi dev main.py
```

Then trigger a `cURL` using:

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"wall_of_text":"A healthy brain helps us feel good in all aspects of life. In order for it to work well, we need to nourish it with healthy foods, thoughts, and activities while also reducing exposure to the stuff that damages it. We collaborated with the Centre for Applied Neuroscience to help you learn more about your brain, how to keep it healthy, and how to feel better. For the next three weeks, you‚Äôll focus on goals like understanding how to support your brain with nutrition and supplements, thinking patterns, and lifestyle adjustments. You‚Äôll also focus on reducing exposure to negative influences."}'
```

System message:

Your input fields are:
1. `wall_of_text` (str)
Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `specialty` (Literal['dermatology', 'orthopedics', 'cardiology', 'neurology', 'psychiatry', 'pediatrics', 'internal medicine', 'family medicine', 'emergency medicine', 'radiology'])
3. `confidence` (float)
All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## wall_of_text ## ]]
{wall_of_text}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## specialty ## ]]
{specialty}        # note: the value you produce must exactly match (no extra characters) one of: dermatology; orthopedics; cardiology; neurology; psychiatry; pediatrics; internal medicine; family medicine; emergency medicine; radiology

[[ ## confidence ## ]]
{confidence}        # note: the value you produce must be a single float value

[[ ## completed ## ]]
In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Classify a wall of text to an appropriate medical specialty and confidence score. If nothing matches (confidence is less than 0.5), return ''
